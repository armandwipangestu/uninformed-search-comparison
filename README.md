## Introduction

### Background

Uninformed search forms the foundation of Artificial Intelligence in solving problems without additional heuristic information. Algorithms such as **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, and **Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)** are designed to explore the _state space_ and determine a valid or optimal path to a goal.

### Problem Statement

How can we compare the performance of `BFS`, `DFS`, and `UCS` based on execution time and computational complexity?

---

## Theory Review

-   The concept of state space and how problems are represented in AI
-   Here are the brief explanation of each algorithm:
    -   `BFS`: level-by-level exploration (FIFO - First In First Out using Queue or Horizontal)
    -   `DFS`: explore as deep as possible (LIFO - Last In First Out using Stack or Vertical)
    -   `UCS`: Exploration based on minimum cumulative cost (priority queue or open and close condition)
-   Theoritical analysis:
    -   Completeness: whether the algorithm guarantees a solution.
    -   Optimality: whether the found solution is the bset (minimum cost or steps).
    -   Time and Space Complexity: how performance scales with branching factor and depth

---

## Analysis and Implementation

-   Graph generation uses the `networkx` library with random edges and optional weights.
-   Algorithms `BFS`, `DFS`, and `UCS` were implemented **from scratch** (no built-in pathfinding).
-   Runtime was measured using the Python `time` module for fair performance comparison.

---

## Case Studies and Results

-   Graph with `100`, `500`, and `1000` nodes

```python
sizes = [100, 500, 1000]
```

### Dataset

Experiments were conducted on random graphs with `100`, `500`, and `1000` nodes.

| Nodes | BFS (s)               | DFS (s)                | UCS (s)                |

### Result Analysis

-   `BFS` is slower as it explores all nodes at each level, but it guarantees finding the shortest path (if costs are uniform)
-   `DFS` executes fastest because it only explores one deep path at a time, but it may miss the optimal solution.
-   `UCS` is the slowest because it must repeatedly reorder the priority queue by cumulative path cost, ensuring the lowest-cost solution.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

| Algorithm | Advantages                                      | Disadvantages                                    |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| BFS       | Complete and finds optimal path (if equal cost) | High memory usage for large graphs               |
| DFS       | Fast and memory-efficient                       | Not guaranteed to find the optimal solution      |
| UCS       | Always finds the minimum-cost path.             | High computational overhead and slower execution |

> [!NOTE]
> While `BFS` and `UCS` require more memory, this limitation is less critical today due to larger available system resources. The key factor is still whether we prioritize speed or optimality.

### Choose BFS or DFS or UCS?

The answer is depends on the situation

1. Choose `BFS` if

-   Always need optimal solution
-   Doesn't have any issue on memory capacity

2. Choose `DFS` if

-   Not always need optimal solution
-   Have limitation on memory capacity

3. Choose `UCS` if

-   Want to find the optimal solution with cost effective
-   If have different weight on each edge or node
